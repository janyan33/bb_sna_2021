## Data
I've combined all (day and night) live observation data into one spreadsheet named bbsna_raw_combined.csv
This spreadsheet contains all information on matings and mountings.

## To do
Check if "attemped mount" should be treated as mounts. If so, add to patch table. Need to ask students what they meant. Same with "tried to mount".
